assignments in R for coursera course https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression/
I took the course session ending May 2 2016

The data files are supposed to be present in the location like:
C:\\Temp\\SharedRW\\coursera-ml-regression\\week-5-assignment\\kc_house_data.csv

Most of the code produces expected answers. In some cases is does not becuase of the probably differnet implementation in R and Python (e.g. regression libs). For the methods that are completely implemented in R, the results are good.

Note the difference of indexing bewtween Python and R. (R starts with 1)

In some cases I looked at and also looked python implmentation of  https://github.com/tjaskula/Coursera/tree/master/Specializations/Machine%20Learning/Regression could see some mistakes and difference in values there.
